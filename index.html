    <h1>Stop Using Big Email Signatures!</h1>

    <p>
        Companies large and small seem to have an obsession with adding lots of unnecessary
        information to their email signatures, stop it, It's distracting.
    </p>

    <p>
        It also makes it harder to find the important information in a chain of emails.

        Hi John,
    </p>
    <p>
        This is an example of a bad email signature.
        It's too long and has too much information.
        It's distracting and makes it harder to find the important information in a long chain of emails.
    </p>

    <h2>
        BONUS POINTS!

    <p>
        On replies, cut the email signature down to just your name.
        There's no need to repeat the same information over and over.
    </p>
    <p>
        Either "Thanks, John" or "Thanks, Jane" or "- John" or "- Jane" is perfectly fine.

        Hopefully by the examples above, you can see how much cleaner and easier to
        read the email chain is with good email signatures, and even better with some bonus points.
    </p>

    <p>
        Bad email signatures are a pet peeve of mine, so I made this site to help spread the word. Many a time I've
        been in a long email chain scrolling to find the information I need, with most of the chain being ridiculous
        sized signatures. It's annoying. Stop it.
